# js-game

A simple game with four buttons (by default) that turn on(inactive) and off(active). 
At the start, they are all in the ‘on’ state.
The goal is to press them in the right order to turn all buttons off; however, each button is associated with one other button (this is a one-way non-changing association). 
Whenever a button is pressed, it flips the state of itself and of its associated button. Each can be pressed in either state.
